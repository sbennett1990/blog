It's been about 6 months (as of April 2019) since I gave up coffee. Well, I didn't give it up
entirely; I have probably one cup per month on average. Giving it up actually wasn't as hard
as I expected, but that's probably because I substituted something else.

Yerba Mate is a fairly hipster drink that originated from Brazil. It's a type of hot tea,
normally enjoyed from a special "guord" cup with a metal straw with a filter on the end.

Though it does contain caffeine, Yerba has tons of healthy properties. Plus the caffeine
content is still lower than an average cuppa joe. Yerba has a whole host of vitamins and
minerals. In fact, it happens to have the right combination of vitamins/minerals
necessary to sustain life (BeBrainFit citation).

I have come to make Yerba part of my morning routine, and in fact i look forward to
sitting down with a hot cup of tea first thing in the morning. I've definitely felt
a difference physiologically of lowering my caffeine intake, and bumping up my nutrient
intake. This is one drink I highly recommend.
