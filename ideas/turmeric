For the last year I have completely overhauled my food habits. Maybe I'll write a 
post on the journey as a whole, but today I want to talk about
a staple that has been key to transforming my health: turmeric.

Turmeric is a spice that has been used in cooking for melinia and not only does
it add a unique, earthy flavor to a dish, it also has tremendous health benefits.
This spice is a potent antioxidant, anti-inflamatory, brain stimulating ingrediant.

One of the best ways to enjoy turmeric is by making it into a tea. There are a few
variations on the so-called "golden milk" drink, and all bear some resemblance to
chai. Below are a couple of my favorite recipes.
